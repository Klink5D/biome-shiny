Meta-Shiny - A Shiny R app for metagenomics analysis, based around the microbiome package.


A student project I'm working on, both to learn more about how to use the Shiny library, and to further my knowledge of metagenomics analyses and pipeline creation.

Right now it's in exceptionally early stages and only displays alpha diversity data with a violin plot, and calculates beta diversity with a few ordination and distance methods. Give it time.
